 * DFS & BFS
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This program utilizes a user defined Graph ADT in order to demonstrate a DFS
 * and a BFS on the vertices in the graph. The DFS will begin at Dallas and
 * visit all other vertices in the graph by choosing the edge with the smallest
 * mileage. After the search is performed, the discovery and back edges will be
 * displayed, as well as the total distance traveled on the discovery edges.
 * Then, the BFS will be performed and the discovery and cross edges will be
 * printed, as well as the total distance traveled.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * INPUT:
 *    <There is no input.>
 *
 * OUTPUT:
 *    DFS - Discovery Edges, Back Edges, and Total Distance Traveled
 *    BFS - Discovery Edges, Cross Edges, and Total Distance Traveled
